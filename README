Yacy software is required. 
Currently, ahmia is listening YaCy from 10.8.0.10:8090.
The YaCy connection is defined in settings.py.

Please see /apache2/ to setup to run with Apache HTTP server.

Note the crontabs. The order of the task is important.
See crontabs file.

Furthermore, you will need to set the rights to the tools.
chmod -R ugo+rx /usr/local/lib/ahmia/tools/
And 
chown -R www-data:www-data /usr/local/lib/ahmia/  
chmod -R u=rwX,g=rX,o=rX /usr/local/lib/ahmia/
And after creating the SQLite database
chown www-data:www-data /usr/local/lib/ahmia
chown www-data:www-data /usr/local/lib/ahmia/ahmia_db

For developers:
Please, at least, validate your Python code with
pylint --generated-members=objects --const-rgx='[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{2,30}$' python_code_file.py
and fix the major problems.


Not required, but recommended for better system performance:

- Edit the process and threads parameters of the WSGIDaemonProcess in apache2/sites-available/django-ahmia
- Use PostgreSQL
- Install PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL
